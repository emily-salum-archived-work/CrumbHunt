Game I made using java in 2020. 
Presentation video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urmSuQsfpsE)


## About the game

You are a mother bird and have to keep your little birds fed. You run in this 2d "maze", similar to pacman, getting fruits and avoiding snakes. As time passes, the winter comes and things get more difficult from then. It was more of a philosophical experience than anything else. 

## How to run

Download this repository and discompact it. Run the file "src/com/happykhaos/main/Game.java".

### Personal sidenote

To be honest, the file structure isn't at its best at all, because at the time I wasn't very knowledgeable about writting proper code.
For the product, and how it makes me feel, I will keep this project in my list of public repositories.
For the quality of the code, I might not keep it for too long. My projects list isn't too big so for now this is good enough, but take it off once my repositories start getting professional.

Aditionally, maybe we could instead.. take a day or two to clean up the mess!
